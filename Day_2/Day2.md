here are the free no auth APIs to play with: [Free API repo](https://github.com/cezary/simple-apis)

we used [this API](http://docs.apis.is/#endpoint-sports) in Day 2,

turns out, the issue was simple depency and versioning trouble
that was solved by adding a line in the code -

To use .ajax method, simply use the full version one.
Try this one (jquery-3.2.1.min.js) instead of slim (jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js)
`<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>`

we got the reponse as this:
