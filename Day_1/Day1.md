![The basic Web Flow](https://www.astera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rest.png)  
fig: The Basic Flow of Web
Here-

- **Client:** The User Side software(Mostly a browser)
- **GET/POST/.... :** The Method of Request, part for networking and data exchange ways, in accordance to TCP/IP standard.
- **JSON/XML** : Refers to data and logic exchange, XML (eXtensible markup Language) to carry data, JS (Javascript) to perform some operations on data or entities. (can do a whole lot of things, we will  see later)
- **REST API:** (REpresentational State Transfer) Just a standard, nothing alien like, it ensures that an API qualifies to perform the minimum functions of a standard API.
  - This helps in ensuring that you get an API that works well as API.
  - For eg, A TV remote controller, should allow you to change channels, backward and forward or browse through list, and explore the available features remotely (at ease of your couch), without the need to touch the TV or other Equipment involvement
- **DATABASE** - The name says it - Data Base - The Base which holds all the data that is required my your software (web app in this case)
- **NETWORK** (the whole scenario, hidden beneath): required to ensure making the whole process possible.

## Let's cover the topics (lil more)

- **XML** ![XML](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/xmlin.png)
  XML is mainly used to carry data here and there.  
  Remember that data are (in most basic way) bits!  
  And sending bits here and there can be difficult to handle, specially if any of those gets misplaced!

  Nevertheless, **we have XML for that**(many more stuff RN, saying to stay at basic level)
  Wrap up data in xml, [parse](https://oxylabs.io/blog/what-is-data-parser#:~:text=Definition,be%20easily%20read%20and%20understood.) data using JS and Voila! Data is now Piece of Cake to handle!
  
- [ ] **AJAX**  
    (yet to add here, add data and make a PR if you like :D)  
- [ ] **JSON**
- [ ] **HTTP**
- [ ] **Markup language**
