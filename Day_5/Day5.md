# Day 5

## Node JS Intro and Setup

## First Node program

Create a new file named hello.js
and write this code in that file:
`console.log("Hello World!");`
and save it.
Then open a terminal at that location and execute:
`node hello.js`

You will get the output as:
`Hello World!`

This shows that now JS works as an independent programming language, and is executed as a process (not just a script inside browser)

## Sync and Async Performance Difference

## Node and NPM

## Writing Custom Modules

## NPM modules
